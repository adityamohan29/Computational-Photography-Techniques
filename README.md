# Computational Photography Techniques

These .ipynb notebooks demonstrate image processing techniques applied on a picture I took when I was in Singapore. Enjoy!

## Brief overview of techniques implemented in the notebooks:-

### 1. CP - Basics #1:-

1. Contours
2. Noise Addition
3. Filters - Averaging, Gaussian
4. Image sharpening
5. Flipping and Rotation
6. Contrast Stretching
7. Histogram Equalized
8. Custom Filter
9. Edge Detection

### 2. CP - Basics Pt.2:-

1. Noise Addition
2. Image Interpolation
3. Channel Extraction
4. Image Morphing
5. Image subtraction

### 3. CP - Long Exposure

Creates a long exposure effect from still frames of videos.
